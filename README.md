A set of utilities for working with libav.

Since libav is a complex library, there is no attempt to wrap every feature for use in openFrameworks.  Rather, this addon is meant to make it easy to add libav libraries across platforms while wrapping some useful features, such as media file meta information, etc.


Note:
Libav static libs compiled with license: LGPL version 2.1 or later
